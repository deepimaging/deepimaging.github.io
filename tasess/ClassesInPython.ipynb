        "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
        "Object oriented programming is a a paradigm which provides a means of structuring the program so that properties and behaviours are bundled into *objects*. Objects are logical subgroups which contain functions and data that are related together. You can also think of objects as things or ideas that you are trying to model through the program. For example, a bank account maybe an object, students enrolled in a class can be objects, characters in a game are objects, and as we shall see later - neural networks and their building blocks can be treated as objects."

        "## Classes\n",
        "Each object is an instance of a *class*. You can think of a class as a blueprint with which you can create new objects. A class should represent a clear concept and provide a well defined interface. They will generally have two components: attributes (or state or data) and methods (or behaviour). We often use class based description to think about the world. For example, when I say cat, you would begin to think about its *attributes* - what colour is the cat, which breed is it, what is the age, does it have a name and so forth. You also would think about its behaviour - is it hungry, is it sleeping, can I pet it, etc. \n",

In python, we have `__init__` method as the initializer ([Why the double underscores, you ask?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8689964/why-do-some-functions-have-underscores-before-and-after-the-function-name)).\n",
