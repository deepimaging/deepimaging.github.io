1. Installing Python: Download the latest version of python3: `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
Install juypter by running these commands in your shell:
```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```
 - MacOS users, you can find your terminal by typing `terminal` in your search bar.
 - Windows users, you should be able to use powershell. For long term happiness though, install the bash shell: [linux - How to enable Bash in Windows 10 developer preview? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36352627/how-to-enable-bash-in-windows-10-developer-preview)

    Alternatively use [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for Python 3.7 and then run `conda install jupyter`

```sh
import numpy as np

import sklearn as skl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy as sp
tf.__version__
```
