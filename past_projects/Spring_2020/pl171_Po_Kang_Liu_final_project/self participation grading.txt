I score my participation grade 4.5 points.
Although I might not really skillful, I think I spend a lot of time on this course. 
I read and study the lecture pretty much, and spend plenty of time on project, 
and completed all by myself
Also, I often ask the questions after class or message Amey via slack. 
Hence, I think I 4.5 points! 
BTW, Thank you professor to let me go back to Taiwan and study remotely. 
It make my family fell safe. Really appreciate it
