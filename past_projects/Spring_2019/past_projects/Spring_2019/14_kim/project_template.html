<p>Over 30 million people are affected by osteoarthritis in the U.S. and over 240 million globally. This disease is often diagnosed by radiographic imaging when it is far too advanced, so novel imaging methods have been at the forefront of research to improve detection of osteoarthritis and understanding native cartilage biomechanics. In order to study cartilage, we must use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as we can see soft tissue with this imaging modality. However, researchers must laboriously manually segment hundreds of images per subject in order to obtain an accurate model of the knee and study the cartilage. By creating these models from MRIs, we can assess cartilage strains before and after activities and quantify compositional changes through relaxation times. Automating the model creation process by using machine learning to segment the hundreds of MRIs can speed up the research 100-fold and also provide potential clinical use.
