In ultrasound imaging, multiple receive elements listen for echos. The signals from each channel are summed together to produce the final image. We sought to find configurations of a limited number of elements that could still give good imaging results. Using less elements allows a faster frame rate and less hardware requirements. We jointly trained a deep neural network to both select which receive elements to use and to accurately segment hepatic blood vessels in liver images. We found that the learned configuration for 4 elements only performed better than equal spacing. We also found that results for 2 elements and for two-aperture spatial compounding agree with conventional ultrasound imaging theory.
