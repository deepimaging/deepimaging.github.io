We demonstrate a novel system for classifying static hand gestures using single-pixel, single-frequency signals obtained with a dynamic metasurface aperture (DMA). DMAs are printed cavities excited by a single port with tunable radiating metamaterial elements. By altering the binary pattern of active elements (called masks), we generate a large number of diverse radiation patterns which serve as a quasi-orthogonal basis for single-pixel, single-frequency sensing. We took measurements of 10 hand gestures using 50 random masks. Instead of solving the inverse system, we trained a deep neural network (DNN) to classify hand gestures. Using a random subset of only 20 masks, we were able to classify hand gestures with >90% accuracy. To further reduce the number of masks necessary to obtain high classification accuracy, we attempted to optimize the physical layer by specifically designing masks in simulation, instead of picking them at random. We discuss simplified scenarios where this technique is applicable, as well as justification for the lack of significant improvement. The success of this system indicates the potential for low-cost, low-power sensing systems which can read human motion, hand movements, or static patterns for the purposes of human-device interaction.
