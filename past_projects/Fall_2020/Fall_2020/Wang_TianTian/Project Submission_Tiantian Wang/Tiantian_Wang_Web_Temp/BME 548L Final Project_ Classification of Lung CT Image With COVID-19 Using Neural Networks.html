<p>By November 23, 2020, SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) has 58,437,864 cases worldwide and has caused 1,384,897 death according to JHU. It has caused tremendous health and economic loss to the human beings. CT image is the most efficient diagnose approach before we develop the PCR testing kits. In this project, I designed a model that could assist the diagnosis of COVID 19 (or possible other virus in the future) from a single CT image. Works include 1)Training using self-designed network and ResNet 50. 2)Study how illumination could affect the training result. 3)Study how the size of sample and ratio of positive cases could affect the result.
