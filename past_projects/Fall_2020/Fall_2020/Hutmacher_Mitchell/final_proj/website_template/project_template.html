This project was meant to use the InceptionV3 neural network to use a trainable
physical layer to optimize classification of chest X-rays of COVID-19 patients
between healthy lungs and those that have pneumonia induced by COVID-19.  The
weights of the physical layer will be restricted from 0 to 1, as representations
of the portion of X-rays that are allowed through after the layer is implemented.
In the fully trained model, the input for the model will be the element-wise
multiplication between the trained mask and the original image, which will then
be passed to a trained InceptionV3 neural network, which will then classify the
image as either a healthy patient or as a patient who has COVID-19.  After my
training was complete, my network was able to classify images at an accuracy
greater than 99%, with sensitivities and specificities greater than 99% as well.
  This is a substantial improvement over the standard sensitivity of rapid COVID
tests used today, which generally have sensitivities around 60-70%.
