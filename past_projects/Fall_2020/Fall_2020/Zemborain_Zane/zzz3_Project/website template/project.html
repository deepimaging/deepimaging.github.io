Dry Eye Disease (DED) and Neuropathic Corneal Pain (NCP) present as similar conditions but have different etiologies. Despite similar signs and symptoms, NCP patients do not respond well to DED therapies and vice versa. As a result, there is a critical need to find an objective measure to accurately differentiate between these conditions.  Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) images of the subbasal nerve plexus may facilitate this goal as both conditions involve disruptions to the corneal nerves. Further, images can be operated upon by an automated computer vision technique, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which may find more success than clinicians in performing image classification. In this paper, I utilize an autoencoder to identify and cluster discriminative features within patches of CCM images and then I identify and quantify those features via an AlexNet classification architecture. Finally, I perform various classification operations on the resulting feature histograms in order to obtain a disease classification of DED or NCP. Unfortunately, the final model was unable to perform much better than random chance (40-60% accuracy).
