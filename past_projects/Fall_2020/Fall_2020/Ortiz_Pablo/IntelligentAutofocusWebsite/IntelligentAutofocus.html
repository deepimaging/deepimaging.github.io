      Our project aims to improve the focusing speed of retinal optical
      coherence tomography systems as well as automate the procedure. Current
      auto-focusing techniques are slow, so they cannot be applied in real time
      and therefore cannot be executed during image acquisition--it has to be
      done beforehand. We trained a neural network to evaluate, from a single
      b-scan, the level of defocus present in the system. This way we are able
      to control the focus level on real time by correcting for it in less than
      0.3s. without the need to interrupt the image acquisition.
<p>
See <a href="IntelligentAutofocus.mp4">this video</a> to observe the system
working in real time. The video shows live-oct volumes. Defocus is introduced 4
times during the video, but the system corrects for all of them very quickly.
