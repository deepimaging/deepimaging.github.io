Segmentation of medical images is an extremely common task typically performed
using various image processing techniques which can be tedious or time-intensive.
The U-Net architecture has consistently proven to be highly capable of performing
automated medical image segmentation. I present a U-Net implementation for the
segmentation of mouse lungs in micro-CT images. Within the network, I explore
the possibility of creating a back-projection filter that is specially optimized to
improve the segmentation process. This added layer could serve to lay the groundwork for additional filter optimizations for other CT image tasks.
 Further work should be done to improve the TensorFlow implementation
of the back projection operation in my code.
