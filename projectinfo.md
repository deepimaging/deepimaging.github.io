Here is some information about the final project:
1. You can work alone or in a group (up to 4 people), required effort will scale with # of people
2. Select a “base” dataset (see examples below)
3. You'll need to simulate parameters of a physical (imaging) system with a base dataset to form a modified dataset
4. You'll then need to train a deep neural network, with the modified dataset, and the physical parameters in mind
5. Please see slides from class for a number of examples and discussions 

Here is a link to the final project instructions: 
[Final project instructions](/data/BME548_Project_Instructions.pdf)

Here is a link to a template for the final project research-style paper:
[Template for research-style paper](/data/paper_template.zip)

Here is a link to a template for the final project short webpage:
[Template for final project webpage](/data/website_template.zip)

Here is a link to the permission form:
[Permission form](/data/permission_form.pdf)

Using the above files, you'll thus turn in the following:
1. A 7-10 minute presentation with slides that you will give to the class during the final period  
2. A short research-style paper (4 pages minimum, 6 pages maximum) that includes an abstract, introduction, related work, methods, results, a discussion, references and at least 3 figures. 
3. The project’s source code
4. A completed web template containing the main results from the research paper
5. A completed permission form


Here are some important dates:
- Final code and presentation due via email: Tuesday November 24 at noon
- Final presentation paper write-up, website template and permission form due: Tuesday November 24 at midnight
- Final presentation time slots: Tuesday November 24, 2pm - 5pm
- Final presentations will occur via Zoom, please coordinate with team members and practice ahead of time!
