        "\n",
        "For the final homework assignment, we will design a microscope using machine learning! In order to do this, we will combine elements of HW3 (CNNs) and HW4 (microscope simulator) into a single end-to-end architecture. In particular, we will convert the white blood cell images into phase/amplitude objects, and then process them through a microscope simulator as we did in HW4, add noise, and then feed the resulting images into a CNN for classification. In addition to optimizing the CNN parameters, we will also be simultaneously optimizing the input illumination incident on the phase/amplitude objects, as well as the shape of the microscope's aperture, to try to improve classification performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, we will walk you through the steps of implementing this joint architecture, leaving some portions blank for you to implement. We will first instruct you to use specific values that we have tested and are known to give reasonable results. Later on, you will revisit the code and explore different hyperparameter settings.\n",

        "    a. Try decreasing the amount of noise added at the last step of the physical layer, for example to half and a quarter of the initial value. Try at least two values. Comment on the gap in performance between the physically-optimized and non-physically-optimized cases.\n",
